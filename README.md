# employee-manager

## Description
- We were tasked with creating a node based app that would access a MYSQL database.
- This app runs an employee management system. The current mock-up let's you manage a Clown Company.
- Here's an example of what the tables look like:

## Installation
- You will need to use 'npm init' and 'npm i' in a command line while in the employee-manager folder.
- This will give you access to both mysql2 and inquirer, which are needed to run this app.
## Usage
- In the terminal instance use the 'node index.js' command. You will then be given prompts to answer. Simply select quit when you are finished.

- Major help from my tutor Dru Sanchez.
